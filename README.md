👋 Hi, my name is Jacob Field!
👨‍🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan
😺 I first started programming in 2014 with Scratch's simple block-based interface
💻 I learned C++ in 2019 and have been using it for all my University projects
🐍 I taught myself Python in 2023 for my summer internship at Trinity Health
🎵 I'm currently working on a program that allows RGB lights to react to the frequencies of music
🏐 For fun, I like to produce music, play guitar, and play sports like volleyball and football
